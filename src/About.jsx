        I’m Dan, a Mechanical Design Engineer from Galway now working in automation and robotics.
        I enjoy turning complex ideas into robust, real-world machines — designing structures,
        mechanisms, and integrated systems that are practical to build and reliable in operation.
        My experience spans high-value automation projects across 3D CAD, detailed drawings,
        system integration, and engineering documentation. 
        This e-Portfolio highlights the projects and skills that represent how I work:
        with precision, creativity, and a strong focus on delivering results.

        <br /><br />

        I’m passionate about robotics, automation, problem solving, and 
        building things that actually work. This portfolio showcases 
        some of the projects, skills, and experiences I'm most proud of.
